/**
 * Overdrive (probably reasonably) sets the max-width of images in embedded
 * documents to 100%. However, when tables with text in one column and a lot
 * of text in another column, Chrome tries to balance the column widths to get
 * the image and the text to take up roughly the same space, so the image
 * taking up 100% of its available table column space does us… no good.
 *
 * Long term, the fix would be to get the table column widths from the Google
 * Doc and inline them into the table HTML… I guess?
